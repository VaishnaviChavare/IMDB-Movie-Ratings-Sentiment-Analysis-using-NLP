# IMDB-Movie-Ratings-Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP

Preprocessed the data using NLTK.

Implemented comprehensive data cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal.

I trained a model on 40,000 movie reviews to analyze the sentiment (positive or negative) using basic techniques like TF-IDF.

I used the Logistic Regression algorithm and got about 88% accuracy.

I tested the model taking a text sentence from the dataset and it gave me correct prediction.

I developed a sentiment analysis that classifies text into positive or negative sentiments. This analysis leverages data preprocessing, and a logistic regression model to provide accurate sentiment classification.
