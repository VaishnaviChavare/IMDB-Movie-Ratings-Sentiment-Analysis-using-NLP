# IMDB-Movie-Ratings-Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP

Preprocessed the data using NLTK.

I trained a model on 40,000 movie reviews to analyze the sentiment (positive or negative) using basic techniques like TF-IDF.

I used the Logistic Regression algorithm and got about 88% accuracy.

I tested the model taking a text sentence from the dataset and it gave me correct prediction.

I developed a sentiment analysis that classifies text into positive or negative sentiments. This analysis leverages data preprocessing, and a logistic regression model to provide accurate sentiment classification.

Key Highlights:
Data Preprocessing: Implemented comprehensive data cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal.

Model Development: Built and fine-tuned a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.

Web Application: Created a user-friendly web interface with Flask for real-time sentiment analysis.

Deployment: Deployed the application using Docker, ensuring a seamless and scalable setup.

This project has been an incredible learning experience, especially in tackling challenges like imbalanced datasets and optimizing model performance. I'm proud of the results and look forward to exploring more in this domain!
